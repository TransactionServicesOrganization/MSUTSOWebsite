            <h2>Road Show (2025)</h2>
            <p>This past spring, our group was able to arrange a road show to visit the big-four firm, EY, in Detroit. While visiting, 
                we received an office tour, lunch, networking, and a very insightful presentation with an extended time for discussion. 
                Members were able to take this opportunity to ask questions and gain a more comprehensive view on the industry and many 
                topics that we have discussed in previous meetings. This event was a wonderful opportunity for members to take the next 
                step to get deeper in understanding complex topics and meaningful networking. Before heading home, we were also able to 
                make a stop at the Detroit Art Institute to enjoy the art and bond as an organization. We hope to visit more firms in 
                the future and make this an annual event!</p>

            <h2>Internal Meetings</h2>
            <p>While we love having guest speakers come in, we also offer internal meetings dedicated to developing our members through
                 studying Transaction Services as a whole, especially through case studies and discussions on current events. During our 
                 internal meetings, one or more of our board members—who have experience in the topic from internships or advanced 
                 classes—will walk through specifically selected case-studies so that members can gain a more tangible experience 
                 of the work done in Transaction Services. These studies are incredibly helpful to gain a more complete understanding 
                 of the field as well as to foster deeper questions and insights to later discuss with visiting professionals.</p>
